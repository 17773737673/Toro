Video List by RecyclerView made simple. Auto play/pause supported with smart caching last playing position.

### Main features:

- Out of the box support for RecyclerView, with LinearLayoutManager and StaggeredGridLayoutManager.

- Built-in Player Manager to support auto play/pause and caching last played position. ( **note that: with Android default Media Player, due to Video's format, encoding, the resume timestamp may be incorrect**). 

- Smart, customizable Strategy to decide when and how a player should start playing.

- Smartly support Grid (with many Video in one window) by built-in Long press listener. Turning ON/OFF in one line of code.
 
- **I create lots of built-in code, but keep Toro highly customizable.** You decide how you want to start your player, but if you don't know, just let Toro go supporting.
